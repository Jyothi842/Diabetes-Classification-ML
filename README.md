# Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical attributes.

## Dataset
The project uses the Diabetes dataset containing medical features such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, Insulin, Age, etc.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Understanding
2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Model Building using Logistic Regression
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix

## Model Performance
The model achieved an accuracy of **76.6%** on the test dataset.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
